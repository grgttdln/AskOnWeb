# AskOnWeb

AskOnWeb is a powerful Chrome extension that transforms your web browsing experience by allowing you to ask questions about any text you encounter on the web. Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models, it helps you understand, analyze, and get insights from web content in real-time.
